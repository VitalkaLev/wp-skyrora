Converting to lossy
Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: *Exec failed* (return code: 1)

*Output:* 
'cwebp' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

Nope a plain cwebp call does not work

Consider setting quality to "auto" instead. It is generally a better idea
